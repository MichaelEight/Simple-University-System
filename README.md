### Before Installation
Make sure you have <code>npm</code> installed! Check it by opening console (cmd) and typing <code>npm --version</code>. If a version is displayed - you're good to go. Otherwise google it and install it.

### How to Install
1. Copy the repository using VS Code or using any other method
2. Open project folder in VS Code
3. Open the console
4. Make sure you are in the right directory (you should be in the same place, where *package.json* is)
5. Enter the command <code>npm install</code>
6. That should install all missing modules and libraries
7. Type <code>npm start</code>
